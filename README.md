# Simulation in 2D of discs inside a swirling boundary
As the title suggests, the aim of this project is the physical simulation in two dimensions of discs inside a swirling boundary. A video demo can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OBc-yOkbhs).

The simulation is event-driven. A detailed description of how it works can be found HERE. This README will explain how to get it up and running.

### Dependency

The animation in this project uses Classic VPython. To install, go to the VPython [website](http://vpython.org/index.html) and click on the appropriate download link in the left-hand sidebar. 

Depending on what Python installation you are using, you may or may not be able to use the VPython modules without having to use VIDLE (which is a VPython fork of IDLE). To test this, run 
```python``` in the terminal and type 
```import visual```
